# Oceanic-Geo-2.0-DIY-data-cable
Do it yourself datacable for the Oceanic Geo 2.0
(might work for others too)

total cost around 3â‚¬ (nth for me as I had all already at home anyway)

The official Data cable from Oceanic is tooo expensive for the value you get,
so I thought about building my own...

As a quick internet search reveals, the Geo 2.0 "talks" basically UART,
with only TX, RX and Gnd connected...

As I had a ESP8266 ESP-01 USB Serial Programmer with CH340 lying around anyway,
I gave it a try - when you have steady hands, it works flawlessly...

Maybe one more hint: The battery has to be full...
